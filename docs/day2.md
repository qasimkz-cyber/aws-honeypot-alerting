# Day 2 â€“ Setting up Cloud Project Environment

Today I set up the basic cloud project environment for my first project.  

### What I did:
- Created a new `cloud-project` folder in the repo (will store project code here).
- Opened a VS Code workspace for the repo.
- Confirmed Git is tracking changes inside the project.
- Prepared to initialize the project with Terraform (for infrastructure setup).

### Next Steps:
- Install Terraform and verify installation.
- Write the first Terraform config file to spin up a simple VM in the cloud.
